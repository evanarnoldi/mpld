# Conclusion & Critique

## Conclusion

> **Key Summary**
>
> The "Marauder's Map" introduces a narrative shift that elevates the Marauders' prominence while reducing the focus on Harry's school friends. This highlights J.K. Rowling's strategic use of plot devices to drive character arcs and thematic depth.

With both “**Frequency Measures**” and “**Closeness Centrality Measures**”, it can be inferred that the prominence of characters in the story rapidly shifted from “**Harry’s Hogwarts Friends**” to “**The Marauders**”.&#x20;

Although the core characters of the story such as Ron Weasley, Hermione Granger, Professor Snape, and Dumbledore still maintain significance within the story, the supporting cast of the story rapidly changes to accommodate the plot shift within the novel.

The literary device introduced by the novel’s author becomes a clever way to progress the plot and introduce new characters, while subtly reducing the significance of the less-important characters as the supporting cast of the story.

It can be inferred that Harry’s idyllic school life rapidly devolves into a dangerous situation as he meddles with a magical map, which happens to be the keepsake of his late father, James Potter, and his band of infamous wizards, “The Marauders”. With the story’s twist and turn especially during the climax, it is necessary for the author to make space for “The Marauders” to shine within the story while “Harry’s Hogwarts Friends” took a backseat to have the focus on the plot remain reliably on the intriguing plot of betrayal.

## Critique

After identifying the conclusion of the research project, it can be said that the author of the series utilized a subtle but highly effective literary device to progress the plot and seamlessly introduce new characters to keep the novel fresh. The seamless introduction and “**intrusion**” of Harry’s late father into the novel is done tastefully that readers might not realize that “**Harry’s Hogwarts Friends**”, who might be more prevalent in the earlier installment of the series, are quickly sidelined to focus more on the overarching plot that involves the late James Potter.

By identifying the existing data in the form “**Frequency Measures**” and “**Closeness Centrality Measures**”, the research manages to prove the novel’s author intention to make a clear separate set of supporting characters that exists within the story before the introduction of the “Marauder’s Map” and after.

However, due to the single individual effort of the project, the result of the research might be lacking in some area, including the number of datasets included and the quality of the analysis itself. In further research, the addition of another group members would immensely enhance the quality of the research further by having another perspective of the story to be analyzed in the research.

During the gathering of the datasets, the author also encounters difficulty in terms of gathering data via **AntConc** as it can be quite difficult to work with in terms of gathering data that is not limited to frequency only. However, the user-friendliness of the tool makes it viable for the author to use with flexibility. Similarly, the usage of **Voyant** to find the weighted result of **co-occurrences** between the characters have helped immensely in creating a visualized data for the research project, although it can be limited during times as well.

Moreover, the author initially tried to use **Gephi** as a visualizer of the gathered datasets. The complex usage of the tools makes it necessary for the author to seek another alternative that is more user-friendly in terms of usage.
