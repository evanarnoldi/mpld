# Introduction & Idea

> **Key Summary**
>
> This project investigates the impact of the "Marauder's Map" on character relevance in _Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban_. By applying Topic Modeling and Network Analysis, it analyzes character appearances before and after the map's introduction.

Analyzing patterns, causes and effect, and correlation in a literary work have been regarded as a common practice of analysis by scholars of literature, in particular to identify impacts of plot points and how it progresses the literary workâ€™s story point.&#x20;

With the help of analyzing textual content digitally, thus the course Digital Text in Humanities, datasets can be analyzed from a literary text which will give an opportunity for scholars to include key facts in their analysis to prove a certain significant plot point in a literary work and how it progresses the story.

Therefore, this research project is made to analyze the impact of an introduction of a key plot device in a literary work and how it affects the prevalence of characters appearance after the introduction of such plot device. The method used is:

* **Topic Modeling**: Analyzes a cluster of words in a set document, which, in this case, is a literary work.
