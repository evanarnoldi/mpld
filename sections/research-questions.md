## Initial Inspiration

Inspired by [Sparavigna (2013)](#user-content-fn-1)[^1] analysis on how Harry Potter’s social network is impacted before and after his admittance in the magical school of Hogwarts during the first installment of Harry Potter’s novel series, which is “Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone”, this research project is made to identify a different set of data to prove a hypothesis of a work in the same series.&#x20;

It can also be inferred that this project is made to identify quantifiable features in a literary text to build upon an “algorithmic elaboration”, as stated by [Ciotti (2023)](#user-content-fn-2)[^2], thereby providing an evidence to the literary argument that will be presented in this paper.&#x20;

## Research Question

For this particular research project, the author aims to identify the increased prevalence of certain sets of characters in “Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban” after the introduction of a significant plot device, named the “Marauder’s Map”. The new dynamic can prove whether the introduction of the “Marauder’s Map” affects Harry’s life, as his idyllic interaction with other fellow Hogwarts students that are outside his inner circle (Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger) is reduced after the introduction of the magical map.&#x20;

As a background, the Marauder’s Map is a magical map that is made to give the location of Harry Potter’s late father, James Potter’s, band of friends who called themselves the “Marauders”. It can be inferred how the introduction of the plot device gradually increased the prevalence of James Potter’s past entourage, the Marauders, while taking away the focus on Harry’s Hogwarts Friends, which the content of the characters would be explained in the “[Datasets](datasets.md)” section.&#x20;

By identifying this phenomenon, we can identify how authors use plot devices in later installments of their literary work to introduce new characters, while seemingly lessening the focus on earlier characters that might not play a significant part in the particular novel. With the dataset, it is also possible to identify whether there are certain characters that only appears either before or after the introduction of the plot device, which in this research, is the “Marauder’s Map”.
