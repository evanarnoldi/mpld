# Validity & Reliability

The validity of the dataset should reliably represent reality as it is picked from the book itself, without any ambiguity in terms of the source data, which is:

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```
United States’ edition of the “Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban”, first American edition printed in October 1999, with the ISBN of 0-439-13635-0
```
{% endcode %}

> **Novel Summary**
>
> “During his third year at Hogwarts School for Witchcraft and Wizardry, Harry Potter must confront the devious and dangerous wizard responsible for his parents' deaths.”

The handpicked characters that revolve around a certain select of characters, which are the “**Harry’s Hogwarts Friends**” and “**The Marauders**”, will reliably reproduce the dataset, taken measure, and the results of this research. However, other researchers might opt to include other characters in the research, as they might regard other characters to represent Harry’s life before the “**Marauder’s Map**” bigger than the ones included in this research.

In that case, even with a bigger sample size, the selected methodologies should be sufficient in identifying the difference of the people present in Harry’s life before and after the “**Marauder’s Map**” in the novel “**Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban**”.
